## [Misc-1] Welcome to CDDC 2020
**Challenge**

Free points for all! See you on Slack! ;)

**Solution**

In the challenge description, it says "See you on Slack" which is an obvious hint to join the Slack Channel. Once in the Slack Channel, the flag was available in the 'details' section.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{g1mM3_M0aRRr_pOiN75}
```

## [Misc-2] ARGH

**Challenge**

I found a binary, together with this long string that looks like some password. I wonder what is it for...

Key: GZ2gXZ3bD2qqNyNxXb5LJ8HfHQtTL5VHA

Attached Files: myprog

**Solution**

First step to analyzing a binary is to check the file header. In this case, the file header in the provided file matches that of an .ELF (Linux executable). When the program was executed, it said that insufficient arguments was passed. In addition, we were given an additional parameter which was a string key. When we executed the program and passed the key at the same time, the flag was returned.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{c0mManD_l1n3_ArguM3n75sSs}
```

## [Misc-3] Add to Your Reading List

**Challenge**

As part of our resistance fighters' training program, we need to arm ourselves with academic knowledge. By the graces of my kind senior, he passed me some recommended reading materials.

One pdf seems to be annotated, while the other isn't. I wonder what is the difference between the two.. Can you spot it?

Attached Files: Reading_Material.zip

**Solution**

In this case, we know that one pdf was modified over another. Using the first tool on Google: https://www.diffchecker.com/diff we can identify the differences between the two pdf's, which contains the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{KNOW_UR_RIGHTS}
```

## [OSINT-1] Better Alternative Than TV

**Challenge**

Looks like we found a clue to the mastermind behind the brainwashing liquid.

The company's name is UnduplicitousCorp, sounds kinda fishy. Let's conduct some basic reconnaisance and see if there's any videos about the company on social media.

**Solution**

The first OSINT challenge was probably the easiest once the oracle was applied. The flag can be seen on Google immediately once the company name was searched. In fact, it was on the Youtube.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{S+@rt_O$!nT}
```

## [OSINT-2] Fun with File Extensions

**Challenge**

Now that we have their company website, it will be helpful for us to know how the company layout is like.

Note: This challenge does not require brute-forcing. There is no need to do so.

**Solution**

Once the pdf was opened we are presented with a chart. At the bottom right of the document, there was an interesting message (more like a hint):
‘I wonder how to get an editable version of this’

Using a PDF editing software, we can move the objects around, which then showcased the flag hidden underneath.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{EVIL_CORP_CH@RT}
```

## [OSINT-3] Transparency is the Best Policy

**Challenge**

The website looks state-of-the-art. As expected of a evil mega conglomerate.

Okay, they're using HTTPS certificate, very secure. Is there any way we can discover what other domains they are hosting?

Note: This challenge does not require brute-forcing. There is no need to do so.

**Solution**

Using the Google Transparency Report, we could see all the subdomain including flag.tt7ncdhj367dh8mu2pb6.unduplicitouscorp.tech

https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/certificates?hl=en&cert_search_auth=&cert_search_cert=&cert_search=include_subdomains:true;domain:unduplicitouscorp.tech&lu=cert_search


**Flag**

```
CDDC20{CERT_TR4SP4RENCY}
```

## [RE (Windows)-1] Decompile Me

**Challenge**

Hello py2exe, nice to meet you!

Attached Files: DecompileMe.zip

**Solution**

As hinted by the challenge, we used a tool (https://github.com/countercept/python-exe-unpacker) to decompile the code and found the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{NiCe-2-MeeT-py2exe~:D}
```

## [RE (Windows)-2] Dissect Me

**Challenge**

LET THE GAMES BEGIN!

Attached Files: DissectMe.exe

**Solution**

Checking the header for the file, it was compressed file. As such, we extracted files with winrar found the flag in the file FLAG.bmp

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{UR-di$$ector}
```

## [RE (Windows)-3] Cheat Me

**Challenge**

Be patient :) Then you can get what you want.

Attached Files: CheatMe.exe

**Solution**

Since it says CheatMe, it is typically asscoiated with the CheatEngine. Hence, that was our approach. By selecting the running Cheatme.exe program and changing the scan type to “Exact value” and value to “All” since we do not know the data type. By entering and changing the value and the hours to '0', the Flag appears.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{T1ck-T0ck_T1ck-T0ck}
```

## [Pwn (Linux)-1] nc

**Challenge**

Hello PwnWorld!

nc.chall.cddc20.nshc.sg 10000

**Solution**

Since it begins with an 'nc', we assumed that it refers to netcat. By interacting with the given details, we receive the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{NiceToMeetYou@PwnWorld}
```

## [Pwn (Linux)-2] (2^31)-1

**Challenge**

I like zer0.

zer0.chall.cddc20.nshc.sg 20002

**Solution**

Since we know that (2^31) - 1 is almost the maximum ((2^32)-1) and the challenge says it likes zero, then we assume that it is using maxium values. So, by setting netcat to the maximum, we retrieved the flag!

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{oO0OoO0o0OoO0Oo}
```

## [Pwn (Linux)-3] Find Singapore Bug

**Challenge**

Let's FSB!

fsb.chall.cddc2020.nshc.sg 30303

**Solution**

We asked the oracle what did FSB mean (apart from Find Singapore Bug) and we found it: Format String Bug (https://github.com/Caesurus/how2fsb). First, we leaked the stack then changed the dump's hex to ascii, and swapped the endians to retrieve the flag!

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{AAAABBBB-Oh~YouLeakedIt-CCCCDDDD}
```

## [Forensics-1] Can't See A Thing

**Challenge**

What kind of lousy photographer takes terrible pictures like these?

Attached Files: img.jpg

**Solution**

Well, it said it was a photographer and a jpg was given. We ran it through an exif tool and got the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{pho70gr4phy_i5_aw3sOmE}
```

## [Forensics-2] Shell History

**Challenge**

What happened to my server? Please help me to investigate.

Username: root / Password: toor

Attached Files: Shell History.ova

**Solution**

Open mounting the file, we used 'ls -al' to list all files. There was a file .ash_history., and since the hint is history, we used this file. Once we 'cat' the file, we had the entire bash history and one of the echo command contained the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{Sh4LL_we_Sh3LL?}
```

## [Forensics-3] Top Secret

**Challenge**

Where is the secret?

Attached Files: TopSecret

**Solution**

In order to extract the file, we mounted file as a .AD1 file on FTK Imager. We added it in as a logical evidence drive and extracted the files.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{Lorem-Ipsum-Foo-Bar}
```

## [Web-1] No Time

**Challenge**

Our project manager couldn't handle the stress from the upcoming deadlines and resigned hastily. Sigh. Now that we are taking over his projects, I wonder if he has left any instructions for us...

http://notime.chall.cddc20.nshc.sg:1337/

**Solution**

We accessed the domain provided and used the developer tool's 'Inspect Element' and found the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{N0_71m3_nO_tiMe_oMG}
```

## [Web-2] VulnLogin

**Challenge**

This is not how you log someone in!

http://vulnlogin.chall.cddc2020.nshc.sg:8090/

Note: Flag format is CDDC20{username_password}

**Solution**

Again, we used the developer tool's 'Inspect Element' and we found some MD5 hashes for the login credentials. We used Crackstation to crack the hashes.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{administrator_password12345678}
```

## [Web-3] Keep Me Posted

**Challenge**

Some weird page. Looks fishy. Please help.

**Solution**

By using Burp Suite, we repeated a POST Request with a Base64 encoding of 'Yes' which returned us the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{YEs5SS_1_4m_aUTh0r1z3DDdD}
```

## [Crypto-1] My Best Friend, Julius!

**Challenge**

Julius is always sending me cryptic messages. Hmm.

JHLZHY_ZLSSZ_ZLHZOLSSZ_IF_AOL_ZLHZOVYL

Note: Decrypted text does not include the flag format "CDDC20{}". Add in the flag format "CDDC20{}" during submission, and ensure that the flag string is fully in uppercase, i.e. CDDC20{SAMPLE_FLAG}.

**Solution**

Obviously a caesar cipher, we used a online decoder to decode it. https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{CAESAR_SELLS_SEASHELLS_BY_THE_SEASHORE}
```

## [Crypto-2] Cryptic Message

**Challenge**

we are not sure what is this gibberish all about, hmm. Can you help us to decode this message?

hq hm kbg jipoox yhnnhatog qb abkmajtaq p mijhim bn hknijikaim, ipaS yidikyikq tdbk hqm djlyiaimmbJ pky ipas mhcdoi hk hqmion. hn, pnqij ybhkg mb, bkl mhcdox rkbarm btq poo qsi aikQjpo hknijikaim pky djimikqm bki'm ptyhikai vhqs qsi mapjqhkg-dbhkq pky qsi abkaoTmhbk, bki cpx dJbytai p mqpjqohKg, qsbtgs dbmmhlox p cijiqjhahbtM, inniaq.

Note: Decrypted text does not include the flag format "CDDC20(}". Add in the flag format “CDDC20{}" during submission, and ensure that the flag string is fully in uppercase, i.e. CDDC20{SAMPLEFLAG}.

**Solution**

This looked like either a rotation cipher or substitution cipher.
In this case, we  used an online substitution solver to solve it, since rotation cipher did not solve it. https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{HERETURNS}
```

## [Crypto-3] Iffy Glyphs

**Challenge**

At first glance this looks like a kid's drawing, but my astute detective instincts tells me otherwise...

Note: Decrypted text does not include the flag format "CDDC20(}". Add in the flag format “CDDC20{}" during submission, and ensure that the flag string is fully in uppercase, i.e. CDDC20{SAMPLEFLAG}.

Attached Files: what_is_this.PNG

**Solution**

In this case, there was all the man, so we refered to the dancing man cipher table to decode it. https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/dancing-men-cipher

**Flag**

```
CDDC{WELOVETODANCEANDCODEALLDAYLONG}
```

## [Network-1] Baby Shark

**Challenge**

Recently the Resistance Fighters have discovered this new thing called Wireshark, it seems to be some kind of tool used for analysing network packets.

We tried to capture a little snippet of traffic while browsing the web just to check out its capabilities. Let's check out what it can do.

Attached Files: easy.pcap

**Solution**

As a pcap file, we immediately loaded into Wireshark. Within wireshark, we found the Confidential.pdf and got the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{TLP_RED_EYES_ONLY}
```

## [Network-2] Mama Shark

**Challenge**

We have received a new packet for analysis.

Oh damn, there's too much more traffic to look through.. Is there a shortcut to find what we're looking for immediately?

Attached Files: noisy.pcap

**Solution**

Again a pcap file, we loaded it into Wireshark. After digging through th files, we found the flag using regex techniques in yumcheese.txt

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{JUST_GIVE_ME_TL:DR}
```

## Very Serious Challenge!

**Challenge**

Please give us your brutally honest feedback!!

https://forms.gle/uGnArnXFoRsgxDZe9

**Solution**

Upon completing the form, we got the flag. That was fast.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{THANK_YOU_FOR_PLAYING}
```

## WARP GATE 4

## [OSINT-1] Funky Transfer Pact

**Challenge**

Being such a huge conglomerate, it can't be that they only have a tiny web server..

**Solution**

This was refering to the big company earlier from the OSINT challenge. Since FTP was open, then we accessed it and found the flag. ftp://unduplicitouscorp.tech

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{@n0nymous_FTW}
```

## [OSINT-2] Follow the Breadcrumbs

**Challenge**

Following the breadcrumbs, this employee seems like an aspiring photographer.

**Solution**

Since the hint is a photographer, we tried to dig social media sites flickr and tumbler. We found him on flickr: https://www.flickr.com/people/188575548@N05/

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{Fl!ckr_0h_Flick3r}
```

## Visual Noise

**Challenge**

I intercepted some emails from Unduplicitous Corp, that had these pictures attached to them. Looks like visual noise but then again, I can't be sure....

Attached Files: so-noisy.png | much-confusing.png

**Solution**

Again, this challenge is a before and after modification challenge. We used a difference checker to check on the difference and got the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{V1suAl_CrYPT0_iS_s0_53cuRE}
```

## ilovedes

**Challenge**

I heard that the CFO of Unduplicitous Corp loves using DES to encrypt his data, LOL.

Attached Files: secret.dat

**Solution**

Since the key is provided and the encryption type was mentioned, we used an online DES decryption tool to decrypt it and got the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{i_l0v3_5yMmetR1c_EnCryp7i0N}
```

## Recycling Bin

**Challenge**

Found this file in one of the Unduplicitous Corp's PCs Recycle Bin. Can you walk me through this?

Attached Files: 1.img

**Solution**

First we ran an exif which yielded no results. So we checked the file headers and found it was a compressed file. Using winrar, we extracted a test.zip from it. We tried to open with winrar and it failed again. So we checked the header again and it pointed us to a excel file. Upon opening it as an excel file, the flag was displayed immediately.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{cArv3_C4Rve_CaRV33eE}
```

## Something's Going On

**Challenge**

Looks like we found a hidden secret left behind by one of the Resistance Fighters while they were snooping around Unduplicitous Corp's network.

All we have to go on is this pcap file. How about it? Can you discover its secret?

Attached Files: analyse.pcap

**Solution**

With the pcap file, we loaded it into wireshark. There were a fre interesting files. But since they are protected, we had to follow TCP streams and upon filtering stream 26, we found that the RSA private and public certificates which we used in Openssl to decrypt the file. 

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{STOP_STRUTTING_AROUND}
```

## What Time Is It? [1]

**Challenge**

What time is it?

**Solution**

First, we converted them in Unix timestamps and then to plaintext.

**Flag**

CDDC20{_ItI_sN3_ver_Too_Lat_eT0_Ask_Wha_tT1_me1_tI5_!!}
```

## Ma GIFs

**Challenge**

Well apparently, the CTO of Unduplicitous Corp love, love, LOVE GIFs! ;)

http://magifs.chall.cddc2020.nshc.sg:13373/

**Solution**

First we generated a .php backdoor using weevely. Following which both the file and renaming the file to .gif was rejected by the server. To bypass, we used burp suite to change the file type from application/php to image/gif during the upload, so the web application will accept it.

Once it was uploaded, we used weevely to get access to the shell.Directory and find the flag by moving up one parent.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{w0W_u_hAz_FlaG!!h3he}

## Great Sphinx of Unduplicitous Corp

**Challenge**

We discovered Unduplicitous Corp's training site for their engineers. The instructions were prettu clear: get to Stage 100 as soon as possible!

http://great-sphinx.chall.cddc20.nshc.sg:1111/

**Solution**

We made a quick selenium script on python which retrieved the maths elements from the page. It ran for about 100 loops as required by the challenge levels to get the flag.

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{Y0u_arE_s0Ooo00_QU1CK_@nd_SM@RT}
```

## Greater Sphinx of Unduplicitous Corp

**Challenge**

Ahh, yet another one. This time round, get to Stage 50 as soon as possible.

**Solution**

Again, we used the selenium script to get us through the stages to get the flag.

**Flag**

## Between 0&1

**Challenge**

While Unduplicitous Corp was conducting Incident Response on several legacy PCs, our trusty Insider, Resistance Fighter XAE found some weird activity on the PC.

Let's investigate.

Attached Files: dump

**Solution**

In this challenge, we used volatility tool to analyse the dump. Since it was in binary, we used an online tool to covert it to text and got the flag.

**Flag**

## How QueeR...

**Challenge**

We realised that Unduplicitous Corp uses this code for their assets tagging. But we can't figure out how exactly to decode it, hmm.

Attached Files: barcode.gif

**Solution**

In this case, we just scanned the QR and got the flag. 

**Flag**

## Suspicious Service

**Challenge**

While conducting reconnaissance on Unduplicitous Corp, we found a suspicious service. Let's figure out what this is.

ss.chall.cddc2020.nshc.sg 7777

Attached Files: SuspiciousSvc

**Solution**

For this challenge, we tried to read header to no avail, so we decided to try and buffer overflow it. That did not exactly work so we decided to exploit the buffer. 

We used the following:
```python -c ‘print(“\x90”*256+”\x00\x3d\x34\x01”)’ | netcat <ip address> <port>```
and got the flag will be returned.

**Flag**

## Secret Code

**Challenge**

What is the SECRET CODE?

Attached Files: SecretCode

**Solution**

For this challenge, we used IDA PRO to reverse engineer the code and got the flag from the code flow.

## WARP GATE 3

## [OSINT-1] There's A T In Every Flag

**Challenge**

Every self-respecting company needs a social media presence. There must be more we can discover about UnduplicitousCorp.

**Solution**

On the twitter, we had found a direct link to their trello through the administrative work and got the flag:

https://trello.com/c/sXSFRP4U/4-cddc-2020-administrative-work

**Flag**

```
CDDC20{TR3LL0_D!$c0v3red}
```

## [OSINT-2] Travel Ban

**Challenge**

Looks like even the CEO is gonna have a hard time getting out of the country. All his billions can't get past those travel restrictions.

**Solution**

Again on the trello page, we found his flight boarding ticket. There was nothing ambigous except for the barcode, which we scanned and found the flag.

**Flag**

```

## [OSINT-3] Who Needs A Password Manager

**Challenge**

The CEO's secretary hates password managers. "Why do you even need one when there is a better way to keep your passwords secret?"

**Solution**

So again on the trello, there was an image on the 'Book CEO hotel' that was password-1.png. By using stegsolve, we could change the offset and obtain the image.

**Flag**

## My Favourite Music

**Challenge**

We found a suspicous WAV file in Unduplicitous Corp's server. Hmm.

Attached Files: original.wav | suspicious.wav

**Solution**

By comparing using Audacity, we got the flag.

**Flag**

## Clickity Clack

**Challenge**

Our trusty insider XAE had planted a network sniffer in one of Unduplicitous Corp's plant office. It's our chance to unravel the secrets of this pcap file!

Attached files: sniffed.pcap

**Solution**

Again as a pcap, there was password required to open it. We retrieved texts from the .pcap using the UsbKeyboardDataHacker tool.
https://github.com/WangYihang/UsbKeyboardDataHacker

Initially, we got the text IamSuperC0olAmiRiTe! which we thought might have been the flag but it was not.
However, examining the header of the .pcap file, it seems like it could have compressed data and using winrar, we could use the text above which retrieved 2 files: Flag.txt and confidential.pdf

**Flag**
